Stock Prices Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a stock prices dataset to
identify patterns, trends, distributions, and relationships in financial data using
Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

The analysis focuses on understanding stock price behavior and trading volume variability
to support data-driven decision-making.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains daily stock trading records with the following features:

 Column       Description
Symbol      Stock ticker symbol
Date        Trading date
Open        Opening stock price
High        Highest price of the day
Low         Lowest price of the day
Close       Closing stock price
Volume      Trading volume


Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas       Data manipulation & analysis
Matplotlib   Basic visualizations
Seaborn      Advanced statistical visualizations


Analysis Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Summary statistics:
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode
   - Standard Deviation
4. Data visualization:
   - Histograms (distribution analysis)
   - Boxplots (outlier detection)
   - Scatter plots (feature relationships)
   - Correlation heatmap
5. Correlation analysis between numerical features


Visualizations Included:
Price distribution histograms with KDE
Boxplots highlighting outliers
Scatter plots showing price relationships
Correlation heatmap for numerical features

Key Insights:
Stock price variables (open, high, low, close) are highly correlated
Trading volume shows high volatility and several outliers
Volume has a weak correlation with stock prices
Dataset is suitable for:
  - Financial trend analysis
  - Volatility analysis
  - Predictive modeling.
